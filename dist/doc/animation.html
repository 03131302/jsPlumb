<h2>Animation</h2>

<p>jsPlumb offers an <code>animate</code> function, which wraps the underlying animation engine for whichever library you happen to be using, and inserts a callback for jsPlumb to repaint whatever it needs to at each step. You could of course do this yourself; it&#39;s a convenience method really.</p>

<p>The method signature is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">jsPlumb.animate : function(el, properties, options)
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments are as follows:
- <strong>el</strong> - element id, or element object from the library you&#39;re using.
- <strong>properties</strong> - properties for the animation, such as duration etc.
- <strong>options</strong> - options for the animation, such as callbacks etc.</p>

<h4>jQuery and the &#39;revert&#39; option</h4>

<p>jQuery offers a <code>revert</code> option that you can use to instruct it to revert a drag under some condition. This is rendered in the UI as an animation that returns the drag object from its current location to wherever it started out. It&#39;s a nice feature. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the animation that runs the revert does not offer any lifecycle callback methods - no &#39;step&#39;, no &#39;complete&#39;, etc - so its not possible for jsPlumb to know that the revert animation is taking place.</p>

<h4>DOM Adapter supported properties</h4>

<p>The DOM adapter supports only <code>left</code> and <code>top</code> properties in the animate method.</p>
