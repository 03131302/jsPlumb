<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>jsPlumb&#39;s documentation is maintained in the associated wiki on GitHub, which is at <a href="git@github.com:sporritt/jsPlumb.wiki.git">git@github.com:sporritt/jsPlumb.wiki.git</a>. A branch that matches the current dev branch is used; at release time this branch is merged into master and then you see it on GitHub.</p>

<p>Documentation is edited locally using Gollum (or by hand) as per the discussion on <a href="https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/wiki/Editing-Wiki-Locally">this page</a>. During development, all of the <code>Documentation</code> links in the demo pages point to <code>http://localhost:4567</code>, as this is the default port on which Gollum runs.</p>

<p>The jsPlumb build script converts all the markdown files into html and inserts them into a final template, copying everything into <code>dist/docs</code>.</p>

<h3>API Documentation</h3>

<p>API documentation, from release 1.5.0, is being generated with JSDoc, as part of the Grunt build.</p>

<p>The build places the API docs in <code>dist/apidocs</code>.</p>
