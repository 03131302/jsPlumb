<h3>Removing Connections/Endpoints</h3>

<p>There are a number of different functions you can use to remove Connections and/or Endpoints.</p>

<h4>Connections</h4>

<h5>Detaching a single connection</h5>

<p>To remove a single Connection, use <code>jsPlumb.detach</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">var conn = jsPlumb.connect({ some params});
...
jsPlumb.detach(conn);
</code></pre></div>
<p>When you call <code>jsPlumb.detach</code> to remove a Connection, the Endpoints associated with that Connection may or may not also be deleted - it depends on the way the Connection was established. The Endpoints <em>will</em> be deleted under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>you created the Connection using <code>jsPlumb.connect</code> and you did not set <code>deleteEndpointsOnDetach:false</code>.</li>
<li>the Connection was created via the mouse by a user on an element configured via <code>makeSource</code> which did not have <code>deleteEndpointsOnDetach:false</code> set.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Endpoints <em>will not</em> be deleted under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>you created the Connection using <code>jsPlumb.connect</code> and you set <code>deleteEndpointsOnDetach:false</code></li>
<li>the Connection was created via the mouse by a user from an Endpoint registered with <code>addEndpoint</code>.</li>
<li>the Connection was created via the mouse by a user on an element configured via <code>makeSource</code> which had <code>deleteEndpointsOnDetach:false</code> set.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Detaching all Connections from a single element</h5>

<p>To detach all the Connections from some given element:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">jsPlumb.detachAllConnections(el, [params])
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>el</strong> may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a String representing an element id</li>
<li>a DOM element</li>
<li>a selector representing a single element</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>params</strong> is optional and may contain:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>fireEvent</strong> - whether or not to fire a disconnection event. The default is true.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Detaching all Connections from every element</h4>

<p>To detach every Connection in jsPlumb:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">jsPlumb.detachEveryConnection();
</code></pre></div>
<p>This leaves all Endpoints in place according to the deletion rules outlined in the description of <code>jsPlumb.detach</code> above.</p>

<h4>Endpoints</h4>

<h5>Deleting a single Endpoint</h5>

<p>To delete a single Endpoint:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">var ep = jsPlumb.addEndpoint(someElement, { ... });
...
jsPlumb.deleteEndpoint(ep);
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>ep</strong> may be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a String, representing an Endpoint&#39;s UUID (when you add an Endpoint you can provide a <code>uuid</code> member for that Endpoint)</li>
<li>an actual Endpoint object (as in the example above)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Deleting every Endpoint</h5>

<p>To delete every Endpoint in jsPlumb:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">jsPlumb.deleteEveryEndpoint();
</code></pre></div>
<p>This has the effect of removing every Endpoint and also every Connection. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> this method is quite similar to <code>jsPlumb.reset</code>, except that this method does not remove any event handlers that have been registered.</p>
